        prior agreements between you and platformOS with respect to the
        Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that
        may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services, third-party
        content or third-party software. These Terms of Service shall be
        governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
        conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not
        subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and platformOS
        agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state
        and federal courts located within San Diego County, California. The
        failure of platformOS to exercise or enforce any right or provision
        of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
        provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a
        court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless
        agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties'

        these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that

        action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement
        and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in
        judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this
        agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other
        business documents and records originally generated and maintained in
        printed form. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for
        convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you

        Welcome to the service provided by platformOS. ("pOS","we", "us"
        and/or "our"). This privacy policy has been created to provide
        information about our company, our website and the services we provide
        (including through our mobile applications) (collectively, the
        "Services") to our users ("you" and/or "your"). This Privacy Policy sets
        forth pOS's policy with respect to information, including personally
        identifiable data ("Personal Data"), that is collected from users of the
        Services.
      info-we-collect: 'Information We Collect:'
      info-we-collect-inner: >-
        When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal
        Data and other information from you, as further described below:
      personal-data: 'Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services: '
      personal-data-inner: >-
        We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such
        information, such as when you register for access to our Services and/or
        third party services (for example, username and email address provided
        by services such as Facebook), provide us with credit card and other
        payment information, use certain Services including withdrawal of funds,
        contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys. Wherever pOS
        collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this
        Privacy Policy.
      by-voluntarily: >-
        By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to
        our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide
        Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be
        transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of pOS
        and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the
        United States.
      non-identifiable: 'Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data: '
      non-identifiable-inner: >-
        When you interact with pOS through the Services, we receive and store
        certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which
        is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be
        used to specifically identify you. pOS may store such information itself
        or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by
        pOS affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such
        information and pool it with other information to track, for example,
        the number of transactions that are effected through the Service, the
        number of messages you send and receive, the total number of users of
        our Services, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service
        providers, and how our users use and interact with the Services. Also,
        in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the
        Services, pOS may conduct research on its customer demographics,
        interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information
        provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an
        aggregate basis. pOS may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data
        with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of
        non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you
        personally. pOS may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to
        describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and
        to other third parties for other lawful purposes.&nbsp; In operating the
        Services (and in particular in making our website available), we may
        also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of
        information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your
        browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide
        additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services
        usage more accurately. For instance, our Services may set a cookie on
        your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to
        remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the
        Services. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect
        Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you
        will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section
        for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a
        new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave
        cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of
        the Services features.
      paragraph1: >-
        We may also employ the use of anonymous identifiers, which are random
        strings of characters that are used for the same purposes as cookies on
        platforms, including certain mobile devices, where cookie technology is
        not available.
      paragraph2: >-
        We may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Services. Web
        beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the
        Service or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain
        personally non-identifiable information and monitor user activity on the
        Services, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to
        tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.
      paragraph3: >-
        We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model,
        operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network
        information including phone number). We may associate your device
        identifiers or phone number with your pOS account.
      paragraph4-title: 'Do Not Track Signals: '
      paragraph4-inner: >-
        We may (and we may allow third party service providers to) use cookies
        or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing
        activities over time and across different websites following your use of
        the Service. Our Service currently does not respond to "Do Not Track"
        (DNT) signals and operates as described in this Privacy Policy whether
        or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the future, we will
        describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.

        pOS uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent
        with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain
        reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for
        which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email or other
        messaging means, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer
        your question or resolve your problem, or if you confirm a transaction
        using the Services, we will use the financial data you provide to
        consummate the transaction. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order
        to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to
        provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such
        services. pOS and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Related
        Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other personally
        non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us
        customize the Services, improve the content and functionality of the
        Services, better understand our users, prevent fraud and improve the
        Services. pOS and its Related Companies may use this information to
        communicate with you regarding the Services or to tell you about
        services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, any
        marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting
        you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In
        addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing
        communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing
        lists, please contact us as indicated below. Note however that as user
        of the Service you cannot opt-out of some administrative communications
        that are reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service
        notifications.

        (including without limitation any Personal Data or other information
        including in the listing) in connection with the operation of the
        Service or any other products or services of pOS, or the promotion,
        advertising or marketing thereof (including publishing that listing and
        other content on the Internet or on Third Party Services such as

        another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide
